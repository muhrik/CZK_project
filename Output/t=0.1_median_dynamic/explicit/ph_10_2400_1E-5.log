Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=2400,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 26400 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.492 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.611 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      26400 (1 initial)
Transitions: 50400
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 187095 iterations and 304.729 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.048 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 304.768 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_2400_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 304.889 seconds.
