Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=2700,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 29700 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.427 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.532 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      29700 (1 initial)
Transitions: 56700
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 210474 iterations and 465.125 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.039 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 465.161 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_2700_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 465.308 seconds.
