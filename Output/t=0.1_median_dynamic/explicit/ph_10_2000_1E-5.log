Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=2000,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 22000 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.326 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.398 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      22000 (1 initial)
Transitions: 42000
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 155923 iterations and 169.906 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.124 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 169.933 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_2000_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 170.11 seconds.
