Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=700,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 7700 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.168 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.202 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      7700 (1 initial)
Transitions: 14700
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 54615 iterations and 21.148 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.041 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 21.164 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_700_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 21.234 seconds.
