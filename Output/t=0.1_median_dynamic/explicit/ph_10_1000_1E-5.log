Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1000,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 11000 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.233 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.27 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      11000 (1 initial)
Transitions: 21000
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 77994 iterations and 48.192 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.026 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 48.211 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_1000_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 48.271 seconds.
