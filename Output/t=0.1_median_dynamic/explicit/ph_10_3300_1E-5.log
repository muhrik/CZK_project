Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=3300,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 36300 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.498 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.589 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      36300 (1 initial)
Transitions: 69300
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 257231 iterations and 729.791 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.057 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 729.835 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_3300_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 730.183 seconds.
