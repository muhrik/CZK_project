Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=2600,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 28600 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.377 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.467 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      28600 (1 initial)
Transitions: 54600
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 202681 iterations and 327.143 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.038 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 327.173 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_2600_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 327.311 seconds.
