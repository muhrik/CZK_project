Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=5,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 55 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.013 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.022 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      55 (1 initial)
Transitions: 105
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 423 iterations and 0.008 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.009 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.014 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_5_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.032 seconds.
