Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1600,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 17600 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.296 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.351 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      17600 (1 initial)
Transitions: 33600
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 124752 iterations and 114.911 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.034 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 114.938 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_1600_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 115.015 seconds.
