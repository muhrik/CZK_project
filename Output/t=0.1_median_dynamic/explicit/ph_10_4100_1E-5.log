Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=4100,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 45100 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.53 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.628 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      45100 (1 initial)
Transitions: 86100
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 319574 iterations and 1022.503 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.056 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 1022.548 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_4100_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 1022.682 seconds.
