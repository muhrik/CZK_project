Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=4600,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 50600 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.503 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.639 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      50600 (1 initial)
Transitions: 96600
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 358539 iterations and 1072.031 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.054 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 1072.08 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_4600_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 1072.208 seconds.
