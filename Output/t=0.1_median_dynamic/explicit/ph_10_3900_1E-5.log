Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=3900,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 42900 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.468 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.598 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      42900 (1 initial)
Transitions: 81900
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 303989 iterations and 884.435 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.062 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 884.477 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_3900_1E-5_new_value"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 884.612 seconds.
