Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=4000,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 44000 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.512 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.608 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      44000 (1 initial)
Transitions: 84000
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 311781 iterations and 970.934 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.053 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 970.978 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_4000_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 971.104 seconds.
