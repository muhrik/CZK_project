Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=4700,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 51700 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.524 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.657 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      51700 (1 initial)
Transitions: 98700
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 366332 iterations and 1263.248 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.063 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 1263.298 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_4700_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 1263.435 seconds.
