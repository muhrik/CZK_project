Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=3400,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 37400 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.442 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.542 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      37400 (1 initial)
Transitions: 71400
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 265024 iterations and 717.291 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.045 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 717.33 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_3400_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 717.551 seconds.
