Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=200,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 2200 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.091 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.108 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      2200 (1 initial)
Transitions: 4200
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 15651 iterations and 1.255 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.013 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 1.267 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_200_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 1.296 seconds.
