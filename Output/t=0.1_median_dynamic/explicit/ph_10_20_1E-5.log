Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=20,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 220 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.032 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.044 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      220 (1 initial)
Transitions: 420
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 1605 iterations and 0.037 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.011 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.044 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_dynamic/explicit/ph_10_20_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.065 seconds.
