Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=50,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 501 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.05 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.063 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      501 (1 initial)
Transitions: 951
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 2147 iterations and 0.062 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.011 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.07 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_50_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.092 seconds.
