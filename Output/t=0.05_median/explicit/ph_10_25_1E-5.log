Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=25,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 251 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.033 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.045 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      251 (1 initial)
Transitions: 476
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 1245 iterations and 0.034 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.009 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.041 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_25_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.06 seconds.
