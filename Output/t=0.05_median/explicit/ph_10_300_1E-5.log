Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=300,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 3001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.098 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.119 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      3001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 5701
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 6942 iterations and 0.844 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.013 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.856 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_300_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.887 seconds.
