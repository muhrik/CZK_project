Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=700,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 7001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.151 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.192 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      7001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 13301
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 11209 iterations and 3.972 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.02 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 3.987 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_700_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 4.03 seconds.
