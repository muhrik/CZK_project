Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1200,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 12001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.22 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.261 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      12001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 22801
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 5272 iterations and 3.308 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.059 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 3.329 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_1200_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 3.425 seconds.
