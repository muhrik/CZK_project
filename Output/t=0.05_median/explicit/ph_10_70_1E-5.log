Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=70,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 701 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.057 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.072 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      701 (1 initial)
Transitions: 1331
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 2773 iterations and 0.093 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.012 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.1 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_70_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.124 seconds.
