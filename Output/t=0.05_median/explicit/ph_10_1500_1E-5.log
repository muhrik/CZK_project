Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1500,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 15001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.248 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.319 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      15001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 28501
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 5351 iterations and 3.757 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.03 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 3.78 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_1500_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 3.848 seconds.
