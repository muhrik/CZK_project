Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=90,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 901 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.062 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.078 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      901 (1 initial)
Transitions: 1711
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 3360 iterations and 0.138 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.011 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.147 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_90_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.171 seconds.
