Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1600,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 16001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.268 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.377 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      16001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 30401
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 5346 iterations and 3.728 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.061 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 3.752 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_1600_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 3.852 seconds.
