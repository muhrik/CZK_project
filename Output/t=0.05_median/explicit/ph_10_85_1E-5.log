Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=85,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 851 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.06 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.075 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      851 (1 initial)
Transitions: 1616
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 3195 iterations and 0.125 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.011 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.133 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_85_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.157 seconds.
