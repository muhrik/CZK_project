Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=20,timeout=0.05,lambda=13.86294362

Computing reachable states... 201 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.03 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.041 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      201 (1 initial)
Transitions: 381
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 1043 iterations and 0.024 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.01 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.031 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.05_median/explicit/ph_10_20_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.05 seconds.
