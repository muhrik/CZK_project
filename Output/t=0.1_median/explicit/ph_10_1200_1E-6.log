Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1200,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 13200 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.234 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.284 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      13200 (1 initial)
Transitions: 25200
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 38410 iterations and 32.279 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.028 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 32.301 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median/explicit/ph_10_1200_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 32.393 seconds.
