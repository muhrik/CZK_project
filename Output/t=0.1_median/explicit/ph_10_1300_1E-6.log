Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1300,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 14300 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.254 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.307 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      14300 (1 initial)
Transitions: 27300
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 41459 iterations and 31.364 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.044 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 31.388 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median/explicit/ph_10_1300_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 31.493 seconds.
