Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=900,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 9900 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.189 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.252 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      9900 (1 initial)
Transitions: 18900
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 31498 iterations and 18.322 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.025 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 18.343 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median/explicit/ph_10_900_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 18.397 seconds.
