Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=800,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 8800 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.178 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.213 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      8800 (1 initial)
Transitions: 16800
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 28820 iterations and 10.609 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.022 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 10.625 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median/explicit/ph_10_800_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 10.695 seconds.
