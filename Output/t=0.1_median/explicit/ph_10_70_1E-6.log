Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=70,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 770 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.058 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.073 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      770 (1 initial)
Transitions: 1470
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 4179 iterations and 0.15 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.013 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.157 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median/explicit/ph_10_70_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.182 seconds.
