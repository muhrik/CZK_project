Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=700,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 7700 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.168 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.202 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      7700 (1 initial)
Transitions: 14700
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 26550 iterations and 8.214 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.043 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 8.23 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median/explicit/ph_10_700_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 8.301 seconds.
