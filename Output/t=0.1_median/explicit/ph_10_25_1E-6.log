Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=25,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 275 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.036 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.05 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      275 (1 initial)
Transitions: 525
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 1780 iterations and 0.045 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.01 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.052 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median/explicit/ph_10_25_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.072 seconds.
