Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1000,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 11000 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.219 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.256 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      11000 (1 initial)
Transitions: 21000
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 33988 iterations and 21.955 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.025 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 21.973 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median/explicit/ph_10_1000_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 22.033 seconds.
