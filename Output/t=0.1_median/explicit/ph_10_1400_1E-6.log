Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1400,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 15400 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.259 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.337 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      15400 (1 initial)
Transitions: 29400
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 43295 iterations and 46.85 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.031 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 46.875 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median/explicit/ph_10_1400_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 46.943 seconds.
