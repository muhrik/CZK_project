Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...

Computing reachable states... 5 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.011 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.047 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      5 (1 initial)
Transitions: 7
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 315 iterations and 0.0 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.412 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.006 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../CZK_project/Output/firstRejuvenation_1E-6_constant/explicit/ev_k_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.449 seconds.
