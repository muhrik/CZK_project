Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1000,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.93147181

Computing reachable states... 11000 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.229 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.268 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      11000 (1 initial)
Transitions: 21000
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 99971 iterations and 73.764 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.027 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 73.787 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_epsilon/explicit/ph_10_1000_1E-9"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 73.853 seconds.
