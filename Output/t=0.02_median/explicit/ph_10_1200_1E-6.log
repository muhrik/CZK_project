Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1200,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 12001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.216 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.256 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      12001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 22801
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 41021 iterations and 23.193 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.053 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 23.212 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_1200_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 23.304 seconds.
