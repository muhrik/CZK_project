Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=20,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 201 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.032 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.043 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      201 (1 initial)
Transitions: 381
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 1506 iterations and 0.03 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.009 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.036 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_20_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.055 seconds.
