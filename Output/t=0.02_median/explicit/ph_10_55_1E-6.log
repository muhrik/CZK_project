Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=55,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 551 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.053 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.068 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      551 (1 initial)
Transitions: 1046
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 3585 iterations and 0.09 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.01 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.097 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_55_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.119 seconds.
