Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=40,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 401 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.045 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.058 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      401 (1 initial)
Transitions: 761
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 2740 iterations and 0.061 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.011 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.067 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_40_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.089 seconds.
