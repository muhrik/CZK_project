Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=600,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 6001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.14 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.165 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      6001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 11401
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 24793 iterations and 5.322 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.018 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 5.337 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_600_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 5.388 seconds.
