Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1600,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 16001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.26 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.33 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      16001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 30401
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 49736 iterations and 28.748 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.066 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 28.771 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_1600_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 28.874 seconds.
