Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1800,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 18001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.291 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.352 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      18001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 34201
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 54023 iterations and 46.53 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.034 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 46.555 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_1800_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 46.631 seconds.
