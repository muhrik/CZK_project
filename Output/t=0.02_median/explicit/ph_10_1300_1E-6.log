Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1300,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 13001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.227 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.275 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      13001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 24701
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 43251 iterations and 28.917 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.028 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 28.937 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_1300_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 29.027 seconds.
