Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=45,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 451 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.049 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.063 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      451 (1 initial)
Transitions: 856
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 3029 iterations and 0.071 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.01 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.079 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_45_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.1 seconds.
