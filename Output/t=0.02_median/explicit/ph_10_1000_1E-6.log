Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1000,timeout=0.02,lambda=34.65735905

Computing reachable states... 10001 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.185 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.243 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      10001 (1 initial)
Transitions: 19001
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 36130 iterations and 17.859 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.024 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 17.878 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.02_median/explicit/ph_10_1000_1E-6"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 17.933 seconds.
