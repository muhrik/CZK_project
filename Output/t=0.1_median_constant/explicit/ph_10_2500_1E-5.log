Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=2500,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 27500 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.373 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.473 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      27500 (1 initial)
Transitions: 52500
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 4656 iterations and 7.394 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.04 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 7.423 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_constant/explicit/ph_10_2500_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 7.514 seconds.
