Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1500,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 16500 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.287 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.338 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      16500 (1 initial)
Transitions: 31500
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 5482 iterations and 4.553 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.033 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 4.576 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_constant/explicit/ph_10_1500_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 4.651 seconds.
