Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=3200,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 35200 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.428 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.517 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      35200 (1 initial)
Transitions: 67200
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 4820 iterations and 11.871 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.043 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 11.904 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_constant/explicit/ph_10_3200_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 12.139 seconds.
