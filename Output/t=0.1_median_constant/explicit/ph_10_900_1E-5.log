Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=900,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 9900 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.196 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.251 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      9900 (1 initial)
Transitions: 18900
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 5328 iterations and 2.15 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.027 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 2.167 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_constant/explicit/ph_10_900_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 2.224 seconds.
