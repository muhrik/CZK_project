Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=4300,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 47300 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.532 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.674 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      47300 (1 initial)
Transitions: 90300
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 4644 iterations and 14.251 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.047 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 14.3 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_constant/explicit/ph_10_4300_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 14.424 seconds.
