Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=1600,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 17600 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.301 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.353 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      17600 (1 initial)
Transitions: 33600
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 4763 iterations and 5.282 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.033 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 5.308 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_constant/explicit/ph_10_1600_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 5.384 seconds.
