Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=3800,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 41800 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.523 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.617 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      41800 (1 initial)
Transitions: 79800
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 4781 iterations and 14.776 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.053 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 14.821 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_constant/explicit/ph_10_3800_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 14.945 seconds.
