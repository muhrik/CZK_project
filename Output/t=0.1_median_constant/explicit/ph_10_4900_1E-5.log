Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=4900,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 53900 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.608 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.757 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      53900 (1 initial)
Transitions: 102900
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 4369 iterations and 14.32 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.052 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 14.374 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_constant/explicit/ph_10_4900_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 14.761 seconds.
