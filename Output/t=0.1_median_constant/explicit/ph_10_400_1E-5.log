Computing steady-state probabilities...

Building model...
Model constants: k=400,timeout=0.1,lambda=6.9314718056

Computing reachable states... 4400 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.114 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.145 seconds.

Type:        GSMP
States:      4400 (1 initial)
Transitions: 8400
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 6805 iterations and 1.139 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.016 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 1.152 seconds.

Printing steady-state probabilities in plain text format to file "../../../../CZK_project/Output/t=0.1_median_constant/explicit/ph_10_400_1E-5"...

Time for steady-state probability computation: 1.187 seconds.
