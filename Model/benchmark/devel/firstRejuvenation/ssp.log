Computing steady-state probabilities...
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 3 iterations and 0.0 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.179 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.0 seconds.
