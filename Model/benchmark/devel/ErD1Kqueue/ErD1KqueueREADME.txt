COMMENTARY:
Default values K=50 and r=5 might take a little too long for the average PC to compute.

MODIFIABLE PARAMETERS: 	K=50, r=5

DSPN EXPLANATION:
Single-server queueing system with Erlangian input (Er/D/1/K).
There are constants K, which is the number of buffers and r, which is the number of phases.

MODEL OPTIMAL VALUE PROBLEM:
None that I noticed.
