COMMENTARY:
asIsMD1NKqueue model also reproduces P4, even though I see it as unnecessarily.
In simplifiedMD1KKqueue model I avoid this.

I highly modified the original DSPN.

MODIFIABLE PARAMETERS: K=5,N=2

DSPN EXPLANATION:
Single-server queueing system with memoryless input from a finite pool of size K and capacity of N (M/D/1/N/K).
(This one enqueues "customers")

MODEL OPTIMAL VALUE PROBLEM:
None.
