COMMENTARY:
MD2Kqueue.pm fdprism model is redundant for K=2, but also supports K>2.
MD22queue.pm fdprism model is optimised for K=2
They both contain concurrent deterministic transitions.

MODIFIABLE PARAMETERS: None

DSPN EXPLANATION:
Two-server queueing system with exponentially distributed arrivals and deterministic service.

MODEL OPTIMAL VALUE PROBLEM:
None.
