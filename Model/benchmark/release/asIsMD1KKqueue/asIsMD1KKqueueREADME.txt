COMMENTARY:
asIsMD1KKqueue model also reproduces P4, even though I see it as unnecessarily.
In simplifiedMD1KKqueue model I avoid this.

MODIFIABLE PARAMETERS: K=2

DSPN EXPLANATION:
Single-server queueing system with memoryless input from a finite pool of size K (M/D/1/K/K).
(This one enqueues "customers")

MODEL OPTIMAL VALUE PROBLEM:
None.
