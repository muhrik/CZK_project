Computing steady-state probabilities...
The model was recognized to be an ACTMC, so ACTMC method will be used!

Initial states are all in one BSCC (so no reachability probabilities computed)
Starting value iteration...
Value iteration took 92 iterations and 0.0 seconds.

Reducing ACTMC to equivalent DTMC took 0.265 seconds.
Computing steady-state probabilities for the equivalent DTMC took 0.0 seconds.

2:=0.15000000000000008
3:=0.05000000000000001

Time for steady-state probability computation: 0.265 seconds.
