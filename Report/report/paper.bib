abstract="Oris is a tool for qualitative verification and quantitative evaluation of reactive timed systems, which supports modeling and analysis of various classes of timed extensions of Petri Nets. As most characterizing features, Oris implements symbolic state space analysis of preemptive Time Petri Nets, which enable schedulability analysis of real-time systems running under priority preemptive scheduling; and stochastic Time Petri Nets, which enable an integrated approach to qualitative verification and quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we present the current version of the tool and we illustrate its application to two different case studies in the areas of qualitative verification and quantitative evaluation, respectively.",

	abstract="In this paper we provide a hands-on discussion of the use of the HyperStar phase-type fitting tool in common application scenarios. HyperStar allows fitting Hyper-Erlang distributions to empirical data, using a variety of algorithms and operation modes. We describe simple cluster-based fitting, a new graphical method for refining the density approximation, a new command-line interface, and the integration of HyperStar with a Mathematica implementation of a fitting algorithm. Furthermore, we describe the use of Hyper-Erlang distributions in simulation. Throughout our discussion we illustrate the concepts on a data set which has been shown to be difficult to fit with a PH distribution.",
